    "more": "This network of consumer aesthetic movements builds on data generated by Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute (CARI), a collective of researchers and designers who catalog consumer aesthetics from the mid-20th century to the present. CARI defines a “consumer aesthetic” as “a visual movement unified by overarching attitudes and themes that survived long enough or became popular enough to be appropriated by capital”; this relationship between culture, capital, and visual artifacts can deepen our understanding of social and economic events. By structuring and visualizing these aesthetic categories as a network, this project seeks to identify aesthetic categories that are important for linking disparate movements and time periods.",
